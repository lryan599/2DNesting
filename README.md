## How to use
Please open `nesting_gui.sln` using Visual Studio. The files are well organized in VS.

## Dependencies
This software can be divided into an engine part and a UI part. The engine is mainly based on CGAL, and the UI is mainly based on Qt. In addition to these two libraries, there are also some other open source libraries applied to this project.

- [CGAL](https://github.com/CGAL/cgal) 5.6.1. You need to ensure that you can use CGAL correctly and download all related dependencies, including boost, libgmp, libmpfr, etc. For details, please refer to the introduction in the CGAL project to ensure that **you can run a demo of CGAL first**.
- Boost 1.84. A famous C++ library, please download it from the official website.
- Qt 6.5.3. The following modules in Qt are required: `core`, `gui`, `widgets`, `opengl`, `openglwidgets`, `svg`, `xml`, `charts`. Please visit the Qt official website and refer to the Qt documentation for installation.
- [libdxfrw](https://github.com/LibreCAD/libdxfrw). Used for simple parsing of DXF files.
- [svg_helper](https://github.com/sorrowfeng/svgHelper). Used for simple parsing of SVG files, which is already included in this Git (svd_helper.h, svg_helper.cpp).
- [rapidcsv](https://github.com/d99kris/rapidcsv). Used for simple parsing of CSV files, already included in this Git (csv.h).
- [wyhash](https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/wyhash). Used for fast hashing, already included in this Git (wyhash.h).
- [emhash](https://github.com/ktprime/emhash) 2.1.0. Used for fast hashing, already included in this Git (lru_size.h).

## Other
This is my undergraduate graduation project. If you have used or referenced this project, please bear **the risk of plagiarism check** on your own.

If you need a similar graduation project, I would recommend using this project in an improved way, including the following three points:

1. On the basis of building this project, implement a **meta heuristic optimization algorithm**. Such as Guckoo Search, GA or DBO.
2. **Use multithreading**. On the one hand, multi-threaded parallelism can be used for computing acceleration (such as OpenMP), and on the other hand, multi-threaded approaches can be used to obtain more diverse results, such as using different random seeds for each thread. The latter seems to be more important than the former.
3. Improve the basic framework of this project. For example, further utilizing CGAL and replacing high-precision numerical types with `double`.

## License
Due to CGAL using the GPL3.0 license, this project can only use the GPL3.0 license. There will be no further major updates for this project, but you are free to ask any questions.
